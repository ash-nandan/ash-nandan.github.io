              DOM is referred to as document object model. It is what holds the
              CSS, HTML and JavaScript together like a glue. DOM is an object
              representation; the objects we learn in JavaScript. Dom is a
              representation of the entire HTML. It is a programming
              intersection that represents the structure of a web page in a way
              that programming languages like JavaScript can understand and
              manipulate. Everything that makes up the DOM is more collectively
              known as nodes. <br />

              <br /><br />
              Each rectangle here are known as nodes. The most top node is where
              the tree begins and its called the root node. In this case, the
              diagram shows the root is the whole HTML document.<br />
              The nodes on the next level connecting them with the root node are
              the "children' of the root node. That's because they are the first
              things within the document.<br />
              Just like that the document node is called the "parent" of the
              html node. The children of html are head and body.<br />
              The body node has its own children nodes which are h1, p and div
              tags.

              The way we can interact with DOM is for example adding an Event
              Listener to an Element. We can add an event listener using the
              method addEventListener Here's an example: The DOM is a compelling
              way to manipulate and interact with web pages and fundamental tool
              for web developers.<br /><br />

              Let's say the html is like a house; it's there. It exists. It's
              the structure. The CSS is the styling; the painting and interior
              decoration. And JavaScript is like doors, the windows, the wiring
              within the house that gives the house a function.

              In web development; the three complement each other just as a
              structure, style and functionality all like in a house. The way
              they combine is that HTML creates the structure, setting up the
              content and layout. CSS adds the style and design making sure what
              we're seeing is appealing. And JavaScript opens up the
              functionality enabling interactions, animations etc. Without HTML,
              there's no structure; without CSS, there's no style and without
              JavaScript there's no interactivity. These combine to create a
              complete and user friendly experience.

              Arrays holds values in a linear, indexed way. Each element is

              Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in
              JavaScript. They are basically set of statements that performs a
              task or calculates a value. Functions are helpful because we can
              reuse it. It can be called multiple times from different parts of
              a program. Also helps us to avoid repeating and duplicating code
              and saves us time. Functions also helps us with debugging;
              isolatating errors, making it easier for us to identify and fix
              the problems.<br /><br />
              Key characteristics of functions are:<br /><br />
              Name: this is a unique identifier for function<br />
              Arguments: also known as parameters; this inputs passed to the
              function<br />
              Return Value: This is the output of the function<br />
              Body: the code inside the function that performs the task.
