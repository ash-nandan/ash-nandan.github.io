              your own emotions as well as others. We can use this awareness to
              guide our thoughts and behaviour. Having emotional intelligence
              helps manage our emotions and to respond effectively to the
              emotions of other people. EI is important because it helps us to
              build stronger relationships. Communicate effectively. Manage
              stress and conflicts better. Helps us to make better decisions and
              also achieve greater success and well-being. emotional
              intelligence can be developed through practice and experiences.
              Some strategies for developing EI include:<br />
              -mindfulness and self reflection<br />
              -engaging in active listening<br />
              -learning to manage stress and negative emotions<br />
              -seeking feedback and constructive criticism

            <p3>
              EQ and IQ are definite measures of human abilities. The main
              differences are:<br /><br />

              IQ: focuses on cerebral abilities, problem-solving and reasoning,
              and thinking speed and also memory. IQ is measured through
              standardized tests. IQ also anticipates academic achievements and
              to some extent professional success.<br />

              EQ: mainly focuses on emotional awareness, social skills and
              relationships. It anticipates success in interpersonal
              relationships, leaderships and teamwork. Can be developed through
              practice, training and experiences.

            <p3>
              EQ can be seen as a key factor in personal and professional
              success. It can help us to build stronger relationships, have
              compassion and manage our emotions/self regulate so whenever we do
              get frustrated we don't lash out on someone else, instead we
              should find ways to calm ourselves; regulate our emotions and
              revisit the problem. EQ also helps us to have empathy, keeps us
              motivated using emotions to achieve goals. It also helps us to
              build social skills; this applies emotional awareness and
              understanding to interact and communicate effectively with other
              people. Humans are social beings, so it makes sense to practice
              EQ. Not only this helps us to have better relationship with
              others, it also aids us to have a better understanding and helps
              us to be nicer to ourselves.
