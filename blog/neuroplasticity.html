              Neuroplasticity is our brain's ability to adapt and recognise
              itself. Neuroplasticity has revolutionised our understanding of
              learning. It refers to our brain's ability to form new neural
              connections and modify existing connections based on experiences
              and environmental factors. Neuroplasticity is the brain's capacity
              to recognise its structure and functions and how it responses to
              learning and enviromental factors. This way, new connections can
              be formed and existing connections can be modified.
              Neuroplasticity plays an important role in different aspects of
              learning, memory and skill development.

            <p>
              •Focused Intention: when you pay attention to what you're doing
              and are highly motivated/interested in what you're focusing on;
              this tells your brain that there's something important there it
              needs to learn and adapt to. <br />
              <br />
              •Movement: exercises are shown to derive neurotropic factor. You
              can also increase neuroplasticity through yoga, learning to play
              an instrument, learning a new language and making art. There's so
              many things you can do to increase neuroplasticity so it's good to
              always explore and find hobbies to help increase brain function.
              <br />
              <br />
              •Another way you can increase neuroplasticity is experiencing
              something new. Maybe you can put yourself through fresh
              experiences and different environments.<br />
              <br />
              •Another great way (believe it or not) to increase neuroplasticity
              is through sleep!! This was found in one of the studies; that the
              brain continues to learn new skills and can improve a task up to
              35% just by sleeping. Here's a link that states the benefits of
              sleeping to increase your neuroplasticity! I found this article
              quite engaging as I am one of those people that neglect sleep and
              this article helped me realise the importance of getting proper
              rest.

          </tr>

          <tr>
            <p>Having growth mindset means seeing failure as a chance to learn. It also means viewing critical feedback as a chance to improve and embrace challenging tasks. Those with growth mindset 
              will most likely see obstacles as a chance to experiement and solve problems. Having growth mindset can help us focus on a journey of continual improvement. These are some of the examples 
              of why having growth mindset is important.<br><br>
              I found this particular article <a href="https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset"
              >Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset</a> quite engaging because not only it talks about the difference between growth mindset and fixed mindset; it also
              talks about the benefits and <i>can a person's mindset be changed?</i>. The article also listed down some examples of what fixed mindset is and it made me realise how much I relate to the 
              fixed mindset side of things and can relate to few of the examples such as avoiding challenges to avoid failure and   <i>'Hide flaws so as not to be judged by others'</i> <br> This article made me reflect back on 
              past years of myself avoiding to learn a new set of skills because I kept telling myself that I'd fail.

            <p>I definitely did get inspired by reading the human skill materials about growth mindset and neuroplasticity. After my research as well, I got even more inspired and had a major realisation 
              that all this time I've had this fixed mindset which affected my emotions such as anger and ego in such a negative way. After researching the difference between 
              growth mindset and fixed mindset; this really made me think of myself as a person and really makes me want to change and practice growth mindset to become a better learner, 
              future developer and fix my short term memory to long term. Having fixed mindset gave me such disadvantage to learning because I always thought to myself<br>  "I'm either good at 
              something or I'm not"<br>  There was no in-between. I didn't even give myself time to learn anything because I kept thinking "no, I won't be good at it and that I will fail" without even trying or 
              having a go at it. So most of the times, because of this fixed mindset I kept thinking of giving up and always made myself feel bad. I've been horrible to myself for so long and this
              eye opening research might actually help me be more mindful about being nicer to myself and give myself time and patience; to learn and grow as a person and shape my neuroplasticity. 
              This was well and truly the best research I've done about shaping my brain in a positive way. This is something I will think about from now on for my benefit. <br> <br>
