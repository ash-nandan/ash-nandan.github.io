              I am more buoyant than I thought, I tend to underestimate my
              ability to adapt to new challenges, and I have the tendency to be
              overly critical of myself, which can sometimes block my progress. I know that I have a lot to learn yet I couldn't be nice and patient with myself and I would get frustrated when 
              I didn't understand something right away. 
               My ego sometimes got in the way of my learning and development. 
               For example, I have a tendency to want to prove myself and show that I am capable, which can
                lead me to take on too much at once or avoid asking for help when I need it.

              The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
              programming is to provide a foundation for effective
              collaboration, problem-solving, and personal growth. Empathy allows us to understand and connect with
              others, fostering teamwork and better communication, however I had a hard time practising this since this style of
              learning is very new to me and I still feel weird going on discord and asking for help on the channel.
              Self-awareness helps us recognize our strengths and weaknesses,
              enabling us to continuously improve and adapt to challenges. I think I'm slowly getting good at this but 
              I still have a long way to go.

              personal growth and development. I have also been surprised by how
              much I have enjoyed the Human Skills learning, and how it has

              The most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning were
              confronting my own biases and assumptions, as well as learning to
              manage my emotions effectively in stressful situations or problem solving. I
              found it difficult to be vulnerable and open with my peers, These
              challenges required a lot of self-reflection and effort to
              overcome, but they are gradually helping me grow as an individual. I always found that things like journaling or writing down
               thoughts and feelings 
              to be a bit of a chore and weird, I never really understood the point of it and I thought it was a waste of time.
               I never really liked it but I'm starting to realise it's usefulness.
               I have found that journaling has helped me to process my thoughts and feelings,
                and to gain a better understanding of myself. Better late than never I guess.

              A programming school focuses on Human Skills learning because
              technical skills alone are not enough to succeed in the industry.
              Effective communication, teamwork, empathy, and self-awareness are
              crucial for collaborating with others, understanding client needs,
              and solving complex problems. These skills help create a positive
              work environment and ensure that developers can adapt to
              challenges, work well in teams, and build meaningful connections
              with colleagues and clients.

              Not at all. The time spent studying Human Skills learning does not feel
              like a waste of time. While technical skills are essential, Human
              Skills are equally important for becoming a well-rounded
              developer. These skills have helped me improve my communication (maybe not with my classmates yet but has helped my 
              personal relationships)
               and problem-solving abilities, which are critical in
              real-world programming environments. Balancing both technical and
              human skills ensures that I am better prepared to collaborate
              effectively and adapt to challenges in my career. I'm glad I got an opportunity to study about Human skills. I had no idea how important they were until I started learning about it.
