              In a previous job as a duty manager at a pub, I faced a
              challenging situation with a family who finished their meal but
              refused to pay, despite not raising any complaints during a meal
              check. I weighed the situation by considering fairness,
              responsibility, and integrity; whether I should give in to the
              customers' demands or stand firm knowing they were being
              unreasonable. Early in my career, I had been taught that "the
              customer is always right," but at the pub, I knew the owner valued
              integrity and would not want me to let these customers walk away
              without paying their $200+ bill after consuming most of their
              dishes. I felt confident in standing my ground, knowing that both
              the owner and my staff would support me. I remained calm,
              professional, and firm, despite the customers becoming hostile.
              When the family wrote a negative review, the owner later confirmed
              that the situation was complicated due to his past with the customer, but
              praised my handling of it. Reflecting on this decision, I’m proud
              that I didn’t back down as giving up and losing revenue would
              have compromised my sense of fairness and integrity. I learned the
              importance of balancing customer service with protecting the
              business’ interests and maintaining professionalism under
              pressure.

              The people around me and my experiences; particularly at my first
              bar job have greatly influenced my values and identity. Growing
              up sheltered, I struggled with being shy and standing up for
              myself. However, working in busy bars and pubs, surrounded by
              supporive colleagues and managers helped build my confidence and I
              learnt how to assert myself. My earlier restaurant jobs, where I
              was taught to always cater to customers, shaped a mentality that
              overlooked my own needs and values. But in the bar industry, I
              learned the importance of fairness, integrity, and standing my
              ground—especially when faced with difficult situations, as I
              mentioned in the previous example. The support from my coworkers
              and managers, and the experiences of confronting wrongdoings,
              taught me to be responsible and confident. These lessons not only
              shaped how I handle challenges but also contributed to my growth
              into someone who now values self-advocacy and fairness.

              The strengths I’ve developed, such as confidence, responsibility,
              integrity, social intelligence, teamwork, and kindness, will
              significantly support me during my learning journey. My experience
              in teamwork, especially as a manager, has taught me how to
              effectively collaborate and support others to achieve common
              goals. This will help me in group learning environments, as I am
              accustomed to planning and dividing tasks to ensure success.
              Social intelligence, developed through years of working in
              hospitality, allows me to read social cues, understand others'
              emotions, and adapt to different situations; skills that will be
              valuable in interacting with peers and instructors. Additionally,
              kindness and willingness to help others will foster a positive
              and collaborative learning environment, where I can both
              contribute and seek support when needed. These strengths will help
              me navigate challenges, build strong relationships, and maintain a
              positive approach throughout my learning journey.

              One of my limitations is self-regulation and impatience. I
              sometimes struggle to manage my anger, especially when things
              aren’t going as expected. I remember during Sprint 1, nothing
              seemed to make sense, and I was frustrated with myself for not
              understanding the material. Although I knew it was a new subject
              and required patience, I was harsh on myself and felt like giving
              up. A few days later, I stopped feeling sorry for myself and
              decided to do my best. However, in the moment, it can still be
              challenging to control my anger, so I recognize that I need to
              work on that. Additionally, I have a tendency to want fast
              results, but I understand that learning takes time. I need to
              consistently remind myself to be patient and allow myself the time
              needed to grasp new concepts.

        <p>
          An example of working productively with others despite resistance would be a time when my workplace hired a new manager. 
          She was somewhat controlling and sensitive. I remember one Sunday when I was running my shift as the duty manager. She kept trying to 
          take control by making calls for me and repeatedly urged me to start sending staff on breaks because she had to leave early. I assured her
           I had everything under control, but it felt like she was trying to overtake my responsibilities, which was uncalled for.

Although I tried to be a good colleague when she first joined—staying out of her way and letting her manage her shifts in her own style—I didn’t 
understand why she was undermining me on my shift. Tension was palpable whenever she was around. Despite this, I focused on doing my job and 
tried to get past the discomfort. However, when she continued to interfere and became more controlling, I decided to confront her each time. She often 
took offense to any feedback, which made the situation difficult.

Recognizing this ongoing issue, I eventually went to the owner, who was aware of similar issues with her. Sometimes, despite your best efforts to 
communicate or let things slide to avoid tension, some colleagues won’t change until it’s escalated to upper management. Fortunately, over time, we 
did develop a better working relationship and started helping each other out.

My strategy was to consistently confront the situation and stand up for myself, and I still believe that was the right approach. If I had to face 
a similar situation now, I wouldn’t change my strategy—open communication and addressing the issue head-on were crucial in resolving the tension.
