          This is actually a funny one. When I was doing the flipflop challenge; I don't know how I ignored the //write your code above this line// instruction and wrote my code below this instruction. 
          I kept getting errors and I started feeling so overwhelmed and frustrated. I went on discord for reference since someone else was stuck on the same problem and I thought it was my code that was the issue. 
          I also asked my partner for help. 
          But the error kept saying that I had already declared the flipflop function and we both were so focused on solving the error messages that we didn't pay attention to where I had put my code.
          So, she told me to rename my code function, that didn't work 
          either. I just felt like giving up. Till I read the instruction again. I assumed I'd have to write my code below the line because for the first 2 challenges I had to write my code below where
           specified. So I just assumed this for flipflop challenge as well. What I learnt is that I really should read the instructions carefully. And this isn't the first time I've made this mistake 
           during foundations course. I really need to get better at reading.

          Not sure I came across a problem I elegantly solved. Though, I remember the deBee challenge and i was majorly stuck on it for over an hour. And I couldn't ask anyone for help since I 
          have a bad habit of studying super late at night when everyone else have gone to bed. But there were new code I wasn't familiar with like .spilt, .filter and .join
          And I kept thinking well I haven't learnt this, how am I going to solve this problem. I decided to go on freeCodeCamp and do some exercises to familiarise myself with even more JavaScript.
           That actually put me at ease. No matter how much I learn or research, it takes a long time for something I've never done in my life to stick to my head. After codecamp, I decided that's enough 
           learning, and I should leave a message for my tutor about the deBee challenge and go to bed. But for some reason I didn't want to stop. I went back to the deBee challenge, read the instructions 
           again which made sense after revisiting it the second time. And the method I used was 'trying something' tried different code a few times and I got it!! Being stuck on this challenge for an hour
            or so did frustrate me a lot. After figuring out the solution, I felt so happy and relived.

          To be fair, I don't have a problem asking for help. My only issue is that I have a terrible sleeping pattern and when everyone else are awake and working on foundations course during 
          the day; I'll be in bed asleep. And when I decide to study; it'll be super late at night like after 10pm and I'll be up all night. But if I'm seriously stuck on something, I do leave a message 
          for my facilitator when I know I won't be able to figure out the problem without their help. I do always feel reluctant to ask
           for help in the group channel though.

           the times I talk to myself in my head wherever I go or whatever I do. My mind is constantly racing especially when I'm talking to myself. And I found out that 
           this helps me a lot to achieve clarity especially when I'm dealing with a problem or if it's something random.

           is new to me and I'm still trying to get JavaScript through my head.

          Not very good at this. This is something I could improve on, although it feels weird asking for help over 
          discord in a group setting from people I don't know or haven't met. I'm good at working in a team and asking for help especially 
          after having a rapport with other students. Or if we started off in a campus and meeting my peers, it would of been easy to ask 
          for help. I've never done this style of learning either, so I'm taking my time getting used to it. For group projects, I definitely 
          will be ok and comfortable asking for help since it'll be just maybe certain number of people in a group working towards the same project/goal.

          I'm really good at this. Whenever I was stuck; usually I try to figure out the problem first all by myself (I guess it's a way of me challenging myself) 
          or ask my partner since she's a developer though she's always encouraging me to research or ask my tutors. I've gotten a lot of answers to my problems
           from research or just sitting back and staring at my screen and experimenting. However, I've always been comfortable asking my tutors for help because 
           it's one on one and I don't feel like I'm asking stupid questions when I'm talking to a tutor compared to in a group setting. I'll definitely will be 
           asking my tutors for help a lot during bootcamp for sure. There's been a few times where I ask my facilitator for help, but then before they reply, I 
           already have figured out the solution.

          I feel like I'm very good at this. Up until now, I never realised I was working with this method all my life. 
          I do admit there are many times I hesitate to ask for help (generally speaking) and I start experimenting and trying
           out different solutions to problems. I do like to experiment and am open to trying out new things and I also like to 
           challenge myself to find the answer, though I do know when to ask help from others when needed.  Many times I've found 
           myself being stuck here and there during Foundations; and I just sit back and stare at my screens till something clicks 
           or think to myself "what if I try this?" and it usually works out for me. Just a breather and pause and experimenting. I used this method a lot for Kata challenge.

          I feel like I'm really good at reflections and thinking about what I've done and how I can improve. 
          I've done this a lot at my previous workplaces which helps me be a better team player and worker. When it 
          comes to course, I am good at writing reflections and my thought and feelings down; it does help me reflect
           my own thought process though most of the times when I'm writing down reflections; I mainly write about how 
           I felt during the moment rather than what I can improve on. I guess in my head I know what I should improve 
           on and I usually don't always bother writing it down.
