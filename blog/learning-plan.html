              At the moment, I just want to complete this course and find a job in this field and build on my skills till
              I'm confident enough to step up and ask for more responsibilities at my job. Especially, since this is my first time 
            learning about coding and web development; it'll definitely take some time to get used to it. But 100% I'm wanting to 
            progress and manage projects one day and be a manager in the future.

            My strenghts when it comes to learning is that I'm confident enough to work in a team and ask for help and cooperate
            with others. I know what it means to be responsible and have integrity towards any of my assignments.
            I do have decent social intelligence which can help me to be a good 
            team player. All these skills will help me with my learning. <br>
            My limitations are self regualtion and imapatience. 
            If I'm working alone, that's when my limitations come into play. But if I know I'm working in a team, I'll be 
            able to have more patience and regulate my anger better. When I'm alone, I tend to get frustrated easily.

              I would like to develop time management skills especially when it comes to balancing my personal life and my learning. 
              Right now, I'm struggling to find time to focus on my learning but if it wasn't for my family emergency, I'm sure 
              I'd be able to give more of my time to do course work.

              Overall, I know I can manage myself well to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and 
              industry/community representatives. 
              I'm a good team player and listener. When it comes to team assignments or even tasks 
              at work, I'm always putting in my 100% to get the job done.
              <br>If things start building up and starts getting to me; I just try my best to do what I can. 
              But I also let one of my facilitators know what's happening with me and see if they're able to help me out. 
              I've been updating my facilitators on my situation and so far they've been very understanding and looks like
              all I can do is carry on and do my best. If I do have any questions about my learning, I do ask for help; so no issue there
              in regards to asking for help.

          If anything, I can always ask my facilitators for help, which I've been doing so far out of the discord channel. 
          At the moment, I haven't asked anything on the group discord channel because I know for sure I'm so behind on my sprints
          and everyone else are way ahead of me; so it doesn't feel right to ask for help on the group channel. I've always been more comfortable
          asking my tutors for help unless I'm working on a team assignment, then I'll ask my team members for help.

          All, I want from the facilitation team is to continue having understanding and patience with me. 
          Dev Academy has been great and I don't feel nervous to ask for any help. They've been very nice and supportive so far. 
        I'm still getting used to this flipped learning style, so I'm a bit slow with my learning as well as having other commitments. 
        It's also my first time in this field, so it'll take me more time to learn and understand the concepts of coding.

          Yes, for almost three weeks and counting, I've had family emergency which took out a lot of my time from my learning. 
          I'm still trying to catch up with my learning and I'm still trying to find time to focus on my course work. 
          I'm struggling at the moment to find balance between my learning and personal life. If it wasn't for family emergency, I would of
          had a lot more time to stay on track with the others.
