              others. I know what it means to be responsible and have integrity

              skills will help me with my learning. <br />
              My limitations are self regulation and impatience. If I'm working
              alone, that's when my limitations come into play and I tend to get
              frustrated easily and overthink. But if I'm working in a team,
              I'll be able to have more patience and regulate my anger better.

              Overall, I know I can manage myself well to work productively and
              safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
              representatives. I'm a good team player and listener. When it
              comes to team assignments or even tasks at work, I'm always
              putting in my 100% to get the job done.
              <br />If things start building up and starts getting to me; I just
              try my best to do what I can. I have also let one of my
              facilitators know what's happening with me and see if they're able
              to help me out. I've been updating my facilitators regarding my
              family situation and so far they've been very understanding and
              looks like all I can do is carry on and do my best. If I do have
              any questions about my learning, I do ask for help; so no issue
              there in regards to asking for help.

              If anything, I can always ask my facilitators for help, which I've
              been doing so far using the discord channel. At the moment, I
              haven't asked anything on the group discord channel because I know
              for sure I'm so behind on my sprints and everyone else are way
              ahead of me; so it doesn't feel right to ask for help on the group
              channel. I've always been more comfortable asking my tutors for
              help unless I'm working on a team assignment, then I'll ask my
              team members for help.

              I don't feel nervous to ask for any help. They've been very nice
              and supportive so far. I'm still getting used to this flipped

              having other commitments. It's also my first time coding, so it'll

              Yes, for almost three weeks and counting ever since this course
              started; I've had family emergency which took out a lot of my time
              from my learning. I'm still trying to catch up with my learning
              and I'm still trying to find time to focus on my course work. I'm
              struggling at the moment to find balance between my learning and
              personal life. If it wasn't for family emergency, I would of had a

              Just like how I mentioned in sprint 2 learning plan about my long
              term goal; this hasn't changed. I definitely know programming will
              take me a bit longer to get used to and learn. So, I just want to
              complete this course and find a job in this field and keep
              building on my skills from there till I'm confident enough to take
              on higher roles and keep climbing. It won't be easy for a new
              comer like me to get there yet with this new language program and
              having a massive shift in career path all of a sudden. But
              hopefully my craving for a stable job keeps motivating me to put
              in effort and complete this bootcamp.

            <p>
              I think my biggest strengths would be getting along with the
              people. I've worked in a lot of group settings before as/in a team
              especially at my previous jobs. I know I can be confident enough
              to speak up and cooperate with others. My limitations would be my
              impatience and not knowing how to regulate my anger and I stated
              this in in my sprint 2 learning plan but mainly if I'm working by
              myself then I tend to be like this. However, I've started
              journaling and have been more mindful about myself, so I am slowly
              learning and practising self regulation. In a group setting, I
              know how important it is to have patience and to not lose my
              temper easily. I try to be very professional when working with
              others. Overall, Human Skills has helped me identify that I don't
              have a problem working with others, but has helped me identify
              that I haven't been taking care of myself and have not been kind
              to myself. But I am slowly getting there.

              The only thing I can think of is probably staying on top of my
              materials. Doing foundations and online learning from the comforts
              of my home had made it a bit difficult for me to just get up, open
              my laptop and get started on the sprints. Just a teeny bit lack of
              motivation but mainly a lot of hestitation and a lot of fear; just
              thinking about opening the materials and getting stuck immediately
              and then feeling dumb and overwhelmed. I struggled with this a
              lot. As for bootcamp, hopefully I don't experience this feeling of
              fear a lot when others are involved. Nothing disappoints me more
              than letting team mates down and them doing all the work. I'm not
              all about that. I'll struggle with tech side 100% but to work
              together and finish projects; I'll do my hardest to put in the
              efforts.

              Support from bootcamp team looks like patience. And I think so far
              I need this a lot from my peers and facilitators for someone who
              doesn't fully understand programming yet. And also maybe a
              physical collabrative space; I'm more comfortable talking face to
              face and solving problems like that till I can be more comfortable
              working online once I have a bit more knowledge about programming.
              I feel like I'm a bit old schooled and this is how I did all my
              learning in the past so will take time to get into this new habit
              of using my screens more to collaborate with other students.

              I expect myself to have more discipline. If I make any mistakes,
              rather than making myself feel bad about it, I should turn it into
              something positive like taking it as a lesson and fix it with a
              smile not a heavy heart. Keep telling myself that I'm still
              learning and should be proud of myself for taking this huge step
              to improve my life, my myself and to want a stable job.
