              At the moment, I just want to complete this course and find a job
              in this field and build on my skills till I'm confident enough to
              step up and ask for more responsibilities at my job. Especially,
              since this is my first time learning about coding and web
              development; it'll definitely take some time to get used to it.
              But 100% I'm wanting to progress and manage projects one day.

              My strenghts when it comes to learning is that I'm confident
              enough to work in a team and ask for help and cooperate with
              others. I know what it means to be responsible and have integrity
              towards any of my assignments. I do have decent social
              intelligence which can help me to be a good team player. All these
              skills will help me with my learning. <br />
              My limitations are self regualtion and impatience. If I'm working
              alone, that's when my limitations come into play and I tend to get
              frustrated easily and overhtink. But if I'm working in a team,
              I'll be able to have more patience and regulate my anger better.

              I would like to develop time management skills especially when it

              Overall, I know I can manage myself well to work productively and
              safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
              representatives. I'm a good team player and listener. When it
              comes to team assignments or even tasks at work, I'm always
              putting in my 100% to get the job done.
              <br />If things start building up and starts getting to me; I just
              try my best to do what I can. I have also let one of my
              facilitators know what's happening with me and see if they're able
              to help me out. I've been updating my facilitators regarding my
              family situation and so far they've been very understanding and
              looks like all I can do is carry on and do my best. If I do have
              any questions about my learning, I do ask for help; so no issue
              there in regards to asking for help.

              If anything, I can always ask my facilitators for help, which I've
              been doing so far using the discord channel. At the moment, I
              haven't asked anything on the group discord channel because I know
              for sure I'm so behind on my sprints and everyone else are way
              ahead of me; so it doesn't feel right to ask for help on the group
              channel. I've always been more comfortable asking my tutors for
              help unless I'm working on a team assignment, then I'll ask my
              team members for help.

              All, I want from the facilitation team is to continue having
              understanding and patience with me. Dev Academy has been great and
              I don't feel nervous to ask for any help. They've been very nice
              and supportive so far. I'm still getting used to this flipped
              learning style, so I'm a bit slow with my learning as well as
              having other commitments. It's also my first time coding, so it'll
              take me more time to learn and understand the concepts of it

              Yes, for almost three weeks and counting ever since this course
              started; I've had family emergency which took out a lot of my time
              from my learning. I'm still trying to catch up with my learning
              and I'm still trying to find time to focus on my course work. I'm
              struggling at the moment to find balance between my learning and
              personal life. If it wasn't for family emergency, I would of had a
              lot more time to stay on track with the others.
